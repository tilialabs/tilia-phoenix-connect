This app provides seamless connectivity between Enfocus Switch and the award winning tilia Phoenix with over 150 dynamic properties controlling virtually all facets of bound, folded, tiled, nested, and die-based imposition, eliminating the need to build pre-defined templates.  

A total of 13 export formats are supported to drive your press and finishing devices:

- Imposed PDF and JDF
- Die/cutting data as CFF2, DXF, PDF, and ZCC
- Detailed text-based reports in XML and JSON
- PDF-based reports
- Vector separation export for varnish and foiling
- PDF-based cover sheets
- Tiling reports
- Phoenix project files

## tilia Phoenix

Built from the ground up to cut costs, tilia Phoenix is a sophisticated true-AI planning and imposition application that has been boosting efficiencies for print service providers across all segments, from packaging, labels, commercial, corrugated, and wide format printing.

**Precise, Dynamic Imposition**

Phoenix Imposition AI takes an entirely different approach to common imposition solutions. Rather than template-driven, it operates according to machine and production requirements to generate print-ready layouts on-the-fly. It factors in parameters, such as job specifications, print devices, finishing requirements, and delivery considerations, to search across potentially millions of possibilities for the optimal layout. When a final option has been selected, tilia Phoenix generates print-ready layouts and JDF or die instructions, and reports, for all devices in the production chain.

**Tight Integration**

Uniting planning and prepress functions, tilia Phoenix can be integrated into your chosen workflow or MIS system to enable fast accurate estimates, shrink prepress time, automate error-prone tasks, maximize media usage, and reduce postpress complexity.
